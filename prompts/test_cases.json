        "prompt": "What is quantization?",
        "reference": "Quantization is the process of converting infinite, continuous values into a finite set of discrete values. In machine learning, it reduces the precision of model parameters to lower-bit integers, which makes models smaller, faster, and more efficient for deployment on various devices. "
